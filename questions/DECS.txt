What are the initial steps a miner must take to validate transactions in the Bitcoin network? * Listen for transactions, ensure no double-spending occurs, and verify digital signatures * Group transactions into a block, , ensure no double-spending occurs and broadcast it to the network * Establish a mining pool, verify the block reward and verify digital signature * 1
What is the purpose of the NONCE in Proof-of-Work? * It adds complexity to the transaction validation process * It is a random number miners must find to solve the hash puzzle * It determines the size of the block * 2
How is the Difficulty adjusted in Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism? * Based on the number of transactions in each block * According to the time required to mine the last 2016 blocks compared to a target of 20160 minutes * Automatically every 4 years during halving * 2
To encourage their work, miners receive incentives (rewards): fees of the transactions contained in the block (priority to the transactions with ?? fees), newly created Bitcoins (?? transaction) * highest, miner * lowest, miner * highest, coinbase * 3
What will happen to blocks in the shorter chain during a fork? * They are surely kept in the blockchain * They are surely canceled and return to the mempool * They might create a new chain but probably they will be canceled and return to the mempool * 3

What is a true sentence about Merkle trees? * They help to verify the total number of transactions * They help to verify the integrity of any transaction * A branch of the tree is enough to check whether any transaction of the block has been modified * 2
What is the method used by X to verify the validity of a Bitcoin transaction T contained in a block? * He checks the digital signature of the sender * He requests the hashes of each sibling and recomputes the root * He compares the transaction ID with a known list * 2
How do miners ensure that each block they produce generates different hashes during mining? * By changing the transaction inputs in the block * By modifying the nonce and extra-nonce fields in the Coinbase transaction * By adjusting the timestamps of the transactions in the block * 2
