<h1>Happy Birthday Web</h1>
<center><img src="images/web20years.png"/></center>

<p>On August 6, 1991, exactly twenty-years ago, <b>Tim Berners-Lee posted the first placeholder page</b>. 
We can consider it as the first website in the world made using the Hypertext Mark-Up Language or HTML.</p>

<p>The web has been though a lot of changes and developments over the past two decades. The list of 
improvements and achievements are already long and we are sure it will evolve some more. From websites to 
chat messaging to e-commerce, spam, news, music, social networks and more, the web has made the world smaller.</p>

<p>Mr. <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, we owe you a lot. 
And to you dear Web, <b>Happy 20th Birthday!!!</b></p>
