<h1>Happy Birthday Internet</h1>
<p><a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Kleinrock">Leonard Kleinrock</a> never imagined 
Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube that day <b>40 years ago</b> when his team gave birth to what is now taken 
for granted as the internet.</p>

<p><i>"We are constantly surprised by the applications that come along,"</i> Kleinrock said as he 
and others at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) prepared to throw the internet a 
40th birthday party on Thursday.</p>

<p><i>"It's a teenager now. It's learned some things but it has a long way to go. It's behaving erratically, 
but it's given enormous gratification to its parents and the community."</i></p>

<p>On <b>October 29, 1969</b> Kleinrock led a team that got a computer at UCLA to "talk" to another one at 
a research institute.<br/>

Kleinrock was driven by a certainty that computers were destined to speak to each other and that the resulting 
network should be as simple to use as telephones.
<i>"I thought it would be computer to computer, not people to people,"</i> Kleinrock said in a nod to online social 
networking and content sharing that are hallmarks of the internet Age.</p>
