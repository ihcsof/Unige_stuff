<h1>Time for Unix nerds to celebrate 1234567890 Day</h1>

<p>It will not be the epochalypse of 2038, Friday, February 13th 2009, offers a moment notable enough for 
some Unix fans to raise a toast.</p>
<p>That's when <b>Unix computer clocks will reach the time of 1234567890</b>: 1.2 billion seconds elapsed from January 1, 1970, 
the official beginning of the Unix epoch. The clock is used not just by Unix, but also by Linux, Java, JavaScript, Mac OS X, 
and various other technologies.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with a good excuse for a party. Just so long as those Unix sysadmins get back to work and 
patch things up so the computer world doesn't grind to a halt in 2038, when today's clocks would run out of positive 
32-bit integers.</p>
